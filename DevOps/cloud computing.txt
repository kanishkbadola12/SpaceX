Cloud Computing: We are working on remote data center rather than on premises data center (pay as we use)

Essential characterstics:

Broad Network access => configure different machines, like routers, switches etc
Rapid Elasticity => we can +- config as per the requirements
Measured Service => we can meter the service

Service Model: Cloud is having all three options, according to demand we can choose the service

SaasS => We are demanding software as a service, we are not paying for hw etc
PaaS => We are demanding platform as a service for example, playstore => platform where we can host our android apps. Google is not responsible why my app is not working. They are responsible for platform related issues
IaaS => purchasing machine from web service provider then we can install application on that. We can configure whole infra

Deployment Models:

Public => publically anybody can access the cloud ex. AWS, GCP, Azure...
Private => only one group on individual can access the clouds ex. banking companies use private cloud. It is used for single organization only
Hybrid => combination of public and private cloud
Community => community can access the clouds ex. banking companies use private cloud. It is used by multiple organization only


Cloud Providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP and openstack


AWS: 

Regions => geographical location of availibility zones
Availibility zone => collection of data centers
